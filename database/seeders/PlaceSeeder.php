                'description' => '<p>Nusa Dua might not be the first destination foodies are thinking about but this might change. Ikan Restaurant & Bar at The Westin Resort Nusa Dua Bali has recently changed to become a more upscale place to eat. The restaurant is right on the beach, making it a perfect place to go for a casual meal during the day or a nicer dinner at night.</p>

<p>Ikan Restaurant offers a variety of fresh seafood and Indonesian-inspired dishes, all masterfully created by Bali-born Chef Fajar Kurniawan Putra. Drawing from his experience with Indonesian, Chinese, and Western cuisine, Chef Fajar has created a casual, delicious, and refreshing easy-to-share menu that features seasonal and local ingredients.</p>

<p>The Bulung, a refreshing seaweed salad with seared tuna and kuah pindang (seasoned fish broth) scented dressing. This wonderful combination flawlessly demonstrates the oceanic identity of Bali. The briny sea fish and umami-packed seaweed salad with a melt-in-the-mouth slightly cooked tuna is a must-try. Since we are in Bali do not avoid the Jimbaran-style, freshly-caught Ikan Bakar, served with sayur urap and sambals. The grilled fish, marinated in Balinese spice paste, was a little crispy on the outside but not overdone in the middle. Perfect!</p>

<p>Satisfy your craving for something special by indulging in one of Ikan Bar\'s signature cocktails, created by Head Mixologist Marlon Hermanto. The Gunung Agung, inspired by the island\'s mighty volcano, is made with Nusa Cana Rum, Falernum and rosella soda. Another concoction to experience is the Italian Job, a refreshing mix of house-made limoncello, prosecco, green apple soda, and dill.</p>

<p>The recent revamp has set a new standard for Nusa Dua\'s venues. Ikan Restaurant & Bar at The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali has become a destination where you can spend a day relaxing with friends and family. With its chill vibes, beautiful view of the ocean and fresh and authentic cuisine, it\'s easy to see why!</p>',
